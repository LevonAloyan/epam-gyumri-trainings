    <b> Biography: </b>
    <div> <i>My students are healthcare providers and Wikipedia is
    one of the most visible and visited sites for health-related information,”
    explained Dr. Weiner. “There’s a lot of incorrect information out there and our
    students have a responsibility to share their knowledge so people can use that
        information to improve their lives.”</i> </div>
    <div>Students edited a bevy of articles on chronic pain, joint pain, physical therapy
        education, doctor-patient confidentiality, spinal disease and sports injuries.</div>
    <div><u>This year, Dr. Weiner noted, due to the high-profile nature of the entries,
        students engaged in a back-and-forth dialog with other Wikipedia editors from around the world.</u></div>
    <div>"Contributing to the physical therapy literature was an extremely worthwhile
    experience,” said student Tamara Levy. “Knowing that we have taken part in perpetuating
    scientific information has given me a greater appreciation for the importance of making
        sure the public receives accurate information.</div>
